# Note (8/21/2023)
The Mount-DiskImage has been replaced with "Mount-VHD -PassThru" to improve the results of the script.

# Shrink UPD or other VHDX with Resize-UserProfileDisk
This Powershell Script is reclaiming white space from User Profile Disk without the need for the installation of the Hyper-V role. This script is scanning recursively for VHDX-files from the selected path. When the User Profile Disk is being used by another process this script will skip this UPD from compacting. This script is compacting the VHDX-files with the DISKPART utility. The script can perform VHDX file defragmentation if this parameter is used. This script has also the possibility to empty white space if this parameter is being used.

# How to use
First, you need to load this function into your Powershell session.
```powershell
Import-Module .\Resize-UserProfileDisk.ps1
```
Now you can use this function. If you only want to shrink the VHDX-files in an specified location. The script is recursive checking the location for VHDX-files. 
```powershell
Resize-UserProfileDisk -path D:\UPD
```
It is recommended to defragment the VHDX files before shrinking them. **(Recommended)**
```powershell
Resize-UserProfileDisk -path D:\UPD -defrag
```
By adding the -ZeroFreeSpace parameter all the free space on this disk will be written and removed to make sure that the free space is dfree on the VHDX-file.
```powershell
Resize-UserProfileDisk -path D:\UPD -defrag -ZeroFreeSpace
```
If you only want to shrink a single VHDX-file you need to specify the -SingleVhdxFile
```powershell
Resize-UserProfileDisk -SingleVhdxFile "D:\UPD\UVHD-S-1-5-21-1813453066-1828016147-3244441213-1125.vhdx" -defrag
```
It is also possible to use SDelete (Secure Delete) to clean free space. The -ZeroFreeSpace parameter will zero all the deleted disk on the VHDX-file.
```powershell
Resize-UserProfileDisk -SingleVhdxFile "D:\UPD\UVHD-S-1-5-21-1813453066-1828016147-3244441213-1125.vhdx" -defrag -ZeroFreeSpace
```
### NOTE
Please note that when using the parameter -ZeroFreeSpace that no active writing operations are performed on the VHDX-files, otherwise data loss may occur.

## Compact VHDX-files with Powershell
It is a huge challenge to compact User Profile Disks (and VHDX files in common), without the use of the Hyper-V role installed. If you have any recommendations or other improvements to this script, please let me know!

## MFT (Master File Table)
On all NFTS formatted file systems, information about a file, its creation date, size, permissions, and similar information is stored in the MFT (Master File Table). This file is placed in the middle of the disk and therefore a compact process may stop when it hits the MFT. It is not possible to compact along with the MFT. If you have a solution for moving the MFT to the end of the used space, please let me know or add it as your contribution to this script
